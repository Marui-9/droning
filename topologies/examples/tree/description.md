## Description
A tree topology has four layers: 1 node, 2 nodes, 3 nodes and 4 nodes. Each node
from one layer is connected to all nodes from the neighbouring layers.
Taking the above schematic, with the four layers L1, L2, L3, L4, and the ten
Drones, consider that D1.1 is connected to D2.1 and D2.2, and D3.2 is connected to
D2.1, D2.2, D4.1, D4.2, D4.3, and D4.4.
