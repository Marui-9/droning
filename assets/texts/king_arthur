The Story of King Arthur

Once upon a time in England, there was a magical #sword stuck in a rock. A sign basically read: “Whoever pulls this out is the king. Good luck, peasants.”

Knights, lords, and gym bros tried. No luck. Then came Arthur—a scrawny kid just looking for a sword to borrow. He casually pulled it out like it was no big deal. Everyone stared.

“Congrats, you’re king now,” someone said.

Arthur blinked. “Wait, what?”

Fast forward: Arthur gets a fancy round table (because squares are overrated), gathers legendary knights, and deals with quests, dragons, and one very dramatic wizard named Merlin.

There’s also the Holy Grail, betrayal, and way too much sword fighting.

Medieval drama? 10/10.
