A Warhammer Battle

The battlefield was grim, dark, and full of dramatic fog because that’s the aesthetic. Two armies faced off, both covered in enough armor to make medieval knights jealous.

Commander 1 roared, “FOR THE EMPEROR!” and deployed a squad of #space_marine warriors who look like they bench press tanks for fun.

Commander 2 sneered. “Cute. I counter with… even more angry guys with spikes!”

Bolters roared, chainswords revved, and somewhere in the chaos, someone yelled, “I HAVE THE HIGH GROUND!” (Wrong universe, but the energy was there.)

Explosions everywhere, #space_marine paint was chipped, what a shame. No one could tell if the strategy was brilliant or just rolling dice dramatically.

In the end, victory went to whoever shouted louder and remembered the rules… mostly.
