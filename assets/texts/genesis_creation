The Creation

In the beginning, God created with his #chadface the heavens and the earth. It was basically a blank canvas—no Wi-Fi, no coffee, total darkness.

God looked around and said, “Let there be light!” Boom—light. No light switch needed. He squinted. “Hmm, maybe a dimmer next time.”

He separated light from dark and called them Day and Night. Day was for productivity. Night was for snacks.

Next, God made the sky because empty space needed some flair. Then land, oceans, mountains—basically Earth’s starter pack.

He added plants: trees, flowers, even kale (for reasons unknown). Also the #black_lotus because it looked cool.

Then came the sun, moon, and stars—because what’s a sky without sparkles?

By Day Six, God created animals and humans.

By Day Seven? Nap time. Creation is exhausting.
