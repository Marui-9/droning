Midway through his life’s journey, #dante realized he’d taken a wrong turn—literally. Lost in a dark, creepy forest with zero cell service, he panicked. "Great," he muttered, "I should’ve just stayed home."

Suddenly, out of nowhere, appeared some wild animals: a sassy leopard blocking the path, a grumpy lion with major attitude, and a wolf clearly hangry. Just as #dante considered negotiating with snacks he didn’t have, along came #virgil, ancient Roman poet extraordinaire.

"Lost, are we?" #virgil quipped.
"Obviously," #dante sighed.

And so, instead of offering GPS directions, #virgil said, "Let’s walk through Hell. It’ll be fun."

#dante, lacking better options, shrugged. "Sure. Why not?"

And thus began the weirdest road trip ever.
