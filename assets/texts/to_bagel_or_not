Hamlet’s “To Bagel or Not to Bagel”

Hamlet stands in the kitchen, holding a plain bagel like it holds the secrets of the universe.

"To bagel, or not to bagel—that is the question."
Translation: "Do I eat this bagel or pretend I’m making healthy choices?"

"Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous hunger…"
"Should I be strong and endure my growling stomach like a hero?"

"Or to take arms against a sea of cream cheese
And by opposing, end them?"
"Or should I just slather on this cream cheese, maybe add some lox, and call it a victory?"

Hamlet sighs dramatically. "Alas, poor carbs—I knew them well."
And then he toasts the bagel.
