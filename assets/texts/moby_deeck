Call me Ishmael. Everyone does, though I’ve considered cooler names like “Wave Crusher” or “Captain Chill.” Anyway, I was bored and broke, so I thought, “Why not go to sea? Cheaper than therapy.”

I signed up for a whaling ship because nothing says “adventure” like chasing giant sea monsters. Enter Captain Ahab—a guy with one leg, a bad attitude, and an unhealthy obsession with a giant white #whale named Moby Dick.

Ahab’s vibe? “Revenge first, safety later.”

The crew? A colorful mix of harpoon experts, weirdos, and one guy who really loved his coffee.

Our mission? Find Moby Dick.

My mission? Not get eaten by a #whale. It would really be a lame way to go out.

Spoiler: Things got… complicated.
